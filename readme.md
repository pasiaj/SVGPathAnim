# SVGPathAnim

Draw an SVG path in sync with page scrolling.

This is plainly a proof of concept. Not something one could use in production.

Usage:

  - Create an SVG path with the same height as your page content.
  - Position it absolutely spanning the whole height of the page.
  - Give the path the id ``path``
  - Scroll
